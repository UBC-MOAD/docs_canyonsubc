Comparing MITgcm ca. 2010 to MITgcm 65c 2014
============================================

In a 2010 paper by Jordan Dawe and Susan Allen, it was found that boundary layer separation was poorly represented in the MITgcm 3d model. Since then, there have been numerous revisions to MITgcm, and so the output from the current model will be compared with the output from 2010. Jordan Dawe has kindly made his data available to us.

Model Runs

Numerical simulations of a 1m diameter rotating tank are run in a two-phase setup. In the first stage, the tank is "spun-up", as it would be in the laboratory. The fluid acheives equilibrium (quiessence) after a certain amount of time and the numerical simulations cease. This is the "spin-up" phase. Following this phase, the external forcing is applied, effectively emulating the tank increasing in rotation rate from :math:`f=0.4s^{-1}` to `f=0.52s^{-1}`. This increase in rotational velocity emulates an upwelling event. It is in this phase that the boundary layer separation occurs and the results will be compared most thoroughly.
