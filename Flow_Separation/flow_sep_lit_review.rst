-------------------------

Using the Princeton Ocean Model (POM), the author was able to simulate flow over an idealized model of the Knight Inlet. The results obtained using this model were then compared to data collected over the Inlet. The model does a poor job of resolving the flow separation in lee of the sill; in particular the model flow demonstrates an apparent overturning which is not evident in the data.

*(a) The numerical model used*

The author argues that the data obtained during the "Knight Inlet Experiment" suggests that the flow is largely 2D in the region during the ebb tide. By assuming 2D flow, the model simplifies significantly and resolution may be increased significantly.

The model uses a free surface, a nonlinear equation of state, suppresses rotational effects, Smagorinsky eddy viscosity, quadratic drag on the bottom boundary (calculated from von Karman's law-of-the-wall).

*(b) Forcing parameters*

The tidal forcing is given as an influx condition on the left boundary (see figure 2 of paper). Maximum velocity acheived is ~62cm/s after 3.5h.
